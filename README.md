# FiveM-Admin-Dash-BETA-project
this is an administrative panel written in PHP that utilises a FiveM server's rcon abilities to ban or kick people in game and it keeps logs of such. This is a beta project, and I am looking to be adding more features to it in the future along with changing some of the bootstrap layout so it looks a little nicer.  Please note that the rcon password for the SiniserRP server that is one of the servers I am making it for, has changed their rcon pass so don't try do anything funny with that. 
#NOTE!!!
I am not aware if this works or not, the webport should be able to communicate with the fivem rcon, but I have not tested it yet as I am unable to do so as I cannot port foward nor purchase a web hosting service and free ones don't do the job right
