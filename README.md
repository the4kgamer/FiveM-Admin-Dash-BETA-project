# FiveM-Admin-Dash-BETA-project
this is an administrative panel written in PHP that utilises a FiveM server's rcon abilities to ban or kick people in game and it keeps logs of such. This is a beta project, and I am looking to be adding more features to it in the future along with changing some of the bootstrap layout so it looks a little nicer.
